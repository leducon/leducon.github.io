  Hey there! "It takes a village to raise a child". Carry on!
</p>

Reading books aloud to children stimulates their imagination and expands their understanding of the world. It helps them develop language and listening skills and prepares them to understand the written word.

The purpose of this club is to promote a love of literature and Chinese language among preschool aged kids in a positive, nurturing environment. 

In the initiative, we are building a community in the Minneapolis west suburb.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/leducon/leducon.github.io/issues/new).

Thanks for reading!
